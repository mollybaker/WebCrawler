#Use
This program is a web crawler designed to search for given keyword on a website, and traverse the linked page inside that website to search for the keyword. If a keyword is found, a message is printed to output. 

I wrote the code to be slow and polite so it wouldn't hit the pages too quickly and overwhelm the server. There is a sleep function that can be amended to quicken the application if desired. 

Please only run this on a website that you have permission to scrape/crawl.

#Installation
A few things need to be installed in order for this to work:

In a command prompt or terminal, type:
```sh
pip install scrapy
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
``` 


#Running
```sh 
python webcrawler.py
```

**I accept no liability for any adverse effects on any information systems, or iillegal or unethical use of this code in any capacity.
